Abstract

Brain tumors pose a significant threat to human health, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment and improved survival rates. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely used for brain tumor analysis due to its superior image quality and non-invasive nature.This study presents an automated brain tumor classification system that leverages machine learning/deep learning techniques to accurately identify and categorize tumors from MRI scans.The proposed model undergoes preprocessing steps such as noise reduction, skull stripping, and contrast enhancement before features are extracted using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).The system is trained and evaluated on publicly available MRI datasets, demonstrating high accuracy in distinguishing between tumor types and healthy brain tissues. The results highlight the potential of automated classification to assist radiologists in clinical decision-making, reduce diagnostic time, and enhance reliability.. Future work includes expanding the dataset, improving model robustness, and integrating the system into real-time clinical workflows
