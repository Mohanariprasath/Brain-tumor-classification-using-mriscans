Abstract

Brain tumors pose a significant threat to human health, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment and improved survival rates. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely used for brain tumor analysis due to its superior image quality and non-invasive nature.This study presents an automated brain tumor classification system that leverages machine learning/deep learning techniques to accurately identify and categorize tumors from MRI scans.
