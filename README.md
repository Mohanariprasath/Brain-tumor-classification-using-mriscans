Abstract

Brain tumors pose a significant threat to human health, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment and improved survival rates. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely used for brain tumor analysis due to its superior image quality and non-invasive nature.This study presents an automated brain tumor classification system that leverages machine learning/deep learning techniques to accurately identify and categorize tumors from MRI scans.The proposed model undergoes preprocessing steps such as noise reduction, skull stripping, and contrast enhancement before features are extracted using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).The system is trained and evaluated on publicly available MRI datasets, demonstrating high accuracy in distinguishing between tumor types and healthy brain tissues. The results highlight the potential of automated classification to assist radiologists in clinical decision-making, reduce diagnostic time, and enhance reliability.. Future work includes expanding the dataset, improving model robustness, and integrating the system into real-time clinical workflows

Introduction

Brain tumors are abnormal and uncontrolled growths of cells within the brain, and they represent one of the most life-threatening neurological disorders. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential for planning effective treatment and improving patient outcomes.Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the most widely used imaging technique for brain tumor detection because it provides high-resolution images of brain tissues without exposing patients to harmful radiation. However, manual analysis of MRI scans is time-consuming, prone to human error, and highly dependent on the expertise of radiologists.

With advancements in artificial intelligence, automated image analysis techniques—especially machine learning and deep learning—have gained significant importance in medical image classification. These systems can learn complex patterns from large datasets and provide consistent, rapid, and accurate predictions.In the context of brain tumor classification, deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in identifying different tumor types, including glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors.

This study focuses on developing an efficient and automated brain tumor classification model using MRI scans. The proposed system includes stages such as image preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification to improve diagnostic accuracy.By reducing analysis time and minimizing human error, such systems have the potential to assist radiologists in clinical environments and enhance overall patient care. Continued research and development in this area can lead to more robust, real-time diagnostic tools that contribute to early intervention and better prognosis.
